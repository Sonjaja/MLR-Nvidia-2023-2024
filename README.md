## Project Overview
Objective of this project is to demonstrate my comprehension of MLR and the process it involves to create the MLR model with limited resources for features.

## Data Sources
- Yahoo Finance
- SEC 10k form for revenue and PE ratio

## Tools
- Excel spreadsheet([#Sept 2023 - 2024 Nvidia price.csv](https://github.com/Sonjaja/MLR-Nvidia-2023-2024/blob/main/Sept%202023%20-%202024%20Nvidia%20price.csv))
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Cleaning
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Adding the column PE_Ratio and Revenue obtained from the 10k form on Excel
3. Sorting date column to ascending order to avoid forward bias
4. Creating RSI, SMA, and Bollinger Band by calculation with existing data
5. drop the rows with missing values
6. ensure the datatypes are all numerical

## Author's Note
- This project was for learning purposes and showcasing the concept of MLR.
- As depicted in the plots, I conclude that this model is not very accurate in terms of predicting the price of Nvidia.
  
## Results / Findings
- High correlation values among features indicate significant multicollinearity.
- Negative R-sqaured value suggests that the model's predictions are less accurate than
simply using the avg value of the target variable for all predictions.
- Plotting shows the features didn't fit with the model very well.
- The model is not suitable for the data,or the data itself have issues. (Probably mix of both)

## Recommendations
- Use longer timeframe than 1 year to have more valuable datasets.
- Remove the features that have high Correlation values to other features.
- Each additional feature needs to add enough marginal r value that itâ€™s worth the tradeoff of overfitting.

## Limitations
- **Data Accessibility**: Due to budget constraints, I opted not to pay for services or subscriptions to obtain data. Consequently, my options for features were limited.
- **Inconsistent Timeframe**: Yahoo Finance allows for flexible timeframes for datasets. While my dataset could have spanned more than a year, other features were restricted. Even a one-year timeframe was challenging and may have introduced inconsistencies in the time data.
- **Time Constraints**: This project was intended to showcase my knowledge. Therefore, I chose not to invest excessive time in exploring additional resources or extending the timeframe of datasets.
